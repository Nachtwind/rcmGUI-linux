# rcmGUI for Linux
This software is intended to be a simple "click and run"-tool to send payloads to a NSW that is in rcm mode.

## Requirements
You will need:

Python3
python3-wx

## Usage
Preparing the tool:
You will need the fusee-launcher to be extracted in the "fusee-auncher" folder and at least one Payload (bin) extracted in the payloads folder.
Then you just have to "sudo python3 rcmGUI.py", select the Payload in the listbox and hit "inject" to start.

## Warranty
I take no responsibility for bricked NSWs or errors occuring by using this software. Please have always a NAND-backup at hand and if you are not sure what you are doing: Dont use it.
